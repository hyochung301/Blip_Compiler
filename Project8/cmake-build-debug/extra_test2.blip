// aerobic capacity test that progressively gets
// more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter
// Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at
// the start. The running speed starts slowly, but
// gets faster each minute after you hear this
// signal *boop*. A single lap should be completed
// each time you hear this sound *ding*. Remember
// to run in a straight line, and run as long as
// possible. The second time you fail to complete
// a lap before the sound, your test is over. The 
// test will begin on the word start. On your mark,
// get ready, start.
// Comments:
// Also tests simple operations with variables
// Hint: check the functions given in Input.cpp
